<h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>The terminator is a robot from a movie that time travels into the past to save someone. I love watching robot movies and got goosebumbs after watching terminator. I decided to make a device that can let me see things like terminator does.

<h2 id="basic-idea">Basic idea</h2>

<p>My idea was to mount a camera and raspberry pi onto my universal VR headset and cast the input from the camera onto a phone through wifi inside the headset after applying face recognition, hand recognition and cool overlays.
<br /></p>

<h2 id="components-used">Components used</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Webcam - For taking video input.</li>
  <li>Raspberry pi - This takes the camera input, applies the overlays and casts to the phone</li>
  <li>A VR headset - To see the output.</li>
  <li>A smartphone - to be put inside the vr headset as a display.</li>
  <li>A Powerbank - To power the contraption.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>

<p>The raspberry pi takes input from a webcam whose footage is passed through a python script, the script then applies overlays after detecting faces and hands with mediapipe and a pretained face recognition model.</p>

<p>The modified frames are streamed onto a website on the local wifi network through a library called flask. The frames are updated live</p>
