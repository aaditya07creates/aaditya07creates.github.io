<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>I was going through my laptop settings one day and found and option for eyetracking, sadly it was disabled as my hardware wasnâ€™t compattible. So I decided to make my own. Instead of eye tracking I felt that hand gestures would be much cooler and make me feel like iron man :D. I did the full project using python.

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>

<p>Using OpenCV to capture frames, I passed it through a hand recognition model mediapipe. It is a python library that is very easy to use and setup.</p>
