## Introduction ##

I was going through my laptop settings one day and found and option for eyetracking, sadly it was disabled as my hardware wasn't compattible. So I decided to make my own. Instead of eye tracking I felt that hand gestures would be much cooler and make me feel like iron man :D. I did the full project using python.

## How it works

Using OpenCV to capture frames, I passed it through a hand recognition model mediapipe. It is a python library that is very easy to use and setup.
