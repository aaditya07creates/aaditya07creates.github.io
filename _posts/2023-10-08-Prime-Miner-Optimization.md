## Optimized prime miner ##

I used the Square Root Theorem for Primality Testing as the base program. It works by taking the new number's square root and checking if prime numbers less than the root can divide it. If they cannot, it is prime. The program's goal is to compute as many primes as it can.

In programming, there are many types of optimizations, but most of them work towards saving resources and time. I implemented such optimizations and mathematical logic to optimize my program.
<br />

## Iterating by 2
We know no prime numbers other than two are even, so we can skip the even numbers by iterating by 2. This optimization halves the loops already.


~~~
number += 2
~~~
<br />
## Memoization
Memoization is an optimization where the results of expensive function calls are stored for reuse. This helps in recursive programs like ours. The primes are calculated and stored in a list to compare with the new number. So we don't have to recalculate each prime every loop.

~~~
while True:
    if is_prime(number, known_primes):
        largest_prime = number
        prime_count += 1
        known_primes.append(number)
~~~

Where do we store these primes? Well, we store them on the RAM! Numbers take up very little digital space so we can store hundreds of thousands of numbers on our RAM with ease. We can monitor the RAM usage with a library called psutil.

~~~
import psutil
process = psutil.Process()
ram_usage_gb = process.memory_info().rss / (1024 ** 3)
print(f"Program RAM Usage: {ram_usage_gb:.2f} GB")
~~~
<br />

{: .box-note}
**Note:** The data structure for storing these vast numbers is a simple Python list. We could have used other data structures like numpy arrays or dictionaries, but on testing, they give a higher time complexity. Numpy arrays are great, but not for our use case. They are excellent for vectorization and operations on massive datasets, but we only need to store and retrieve data.
<br />

## Five divisibility
If a number ends with 0 or 5, it is divisible by 5. We can use this logic to skip many checks and reduce our complexity even further.

~~~
if n % 10 in (0, 5):
    return False
    return False
~~~

<br />

## Redundant calculations
Instead of iterating through known primes and checking each time if the prime's square is greater than the new number we can reverse it. Initially, on receiving the new number we can calculate its square root and simply check if the prime in our list is greater than the square root. As the numbers get bigger this optimization makes a hugeÂ difference.

<br />

## Multithreading
This is where things get complicated, my knowledge on thread locking is limited and I came across many errors while trying to optimize the code using this method. Multithreading means to utilize more of your cpu's resources when usually python scripts only run on a single thread, here we mine multiple primes at once across many threads. The errors I came across are called "Race errors" that occur in recursive functions like mine or where shared resources are being accessed. The error is that the prime numbers are being checked require information that the other threads are still working on and have not contributed yet, so one function is trying to access missing data and fails to complete. We can fix this by using proper thread locking and bypassing memoization on coming across a race error. I will try my best to learn and apply this knowledge when I finishe researching more about this topic.
