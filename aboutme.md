I am Aaditya Bhave, if you were to ask me to describe myself in one sentence: I'm passionate about learning, pushing boundaries, exploring new ideas, reading and creating.

# Hobbies and interests
I have many hobbies, some that I really enjoy are robotics, coding, lego and gaming. My interests are mostly about new developments in science and technology. I enjoy reading about topics about the mysteries of space and emerging tech. 

# Strengths and weaknesses

* Strengths
    * Curiosity : I am always excited to learn new things
    * Creativity : I love making things that I can interact with
    * Persistence : I don't give up easily

* Weaknesses
    * Overcommitment : I often get very excited about things and take up multiple tasks at once which tends to be a problem later on
    * Perfectionism : Trying to be perfect in what I do, I forget to manage time. For example I don't like to move on from a concept I haven't fully understood.
